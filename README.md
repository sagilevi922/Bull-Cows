# Bulls Cows - Operating Systems Course.


Bulls and Cows is a 2 player game. 
One player thinks of a number, while the other player tries to guess it.
The number to be guessed must be a 4 digit number, using only digits from 1 - 9, each digit atmost once. 
For every guess that the player makes, he gets 2 values - the number of bulls and the number of cows. 

1 bull means the guess contains and the target number have 1 digit in common, and in the correct position.
1 cow means the guess and the target have 1 digit in common, but not in correct position.

The game ends with win if one of the player guessed right the other 4 digits.
It can also ends with tie if both of the players guessed right the other 4 digits in the same turn.

The software receives updates from the server, and presents them to the player. The client software does not understand the rules of the game.
It is a bridge between the players and the server software.
